#### Brief Description of Project - We have designed a web system for "Limali spices (PVT) ltd" which is a spice manufacturing company located in Malabe. They mainly supply Chili powder, chili flakes, curry powder. Roasted curry powder, meat curry powder throughout the country. All the previous workload was done manually and we are designed to migrate it in to a web-based system integrated with a mobile application in order to enhance the effectiveness of the organization. Basically, the system is designed to cooperate with the raw ingredient suppliers, customers and manage the interior system that is included in the organization. The system is mainly wrapped around customers, suppliers, employee, product, branch, stock, inquiry and delivery. Customer management, Employee management, registration management, branch management, stock management, admin management, supplier management, delivery management, inquiry management, product management and delivery management can be handled by this system. Customers, Suppliers, managers, employees and admin panel can login to the system with user credentials with respective privileges. “Limali spices” have their several branches in different locations where the all branches are combined in this system. The stock management procedure is also done through this system. Managers and employees are able to login to the system with their user credentials and they have restricted privileges. And also, the deliveries that are done in the organization are displayed in the system. The product prices and product details are displayed here in order to make the convenience of the system users. Suppliers are able to request to register to the system and the registration of the supplier undergoes in several processes in order to inspect the quality. This is considered and judged by the quality panel of the business and proceeds the registration. After registering they can edit or delete their profile page and checkout the purchase history. Supplier dashboard, supplier report page, supplier login page can be visited by a registered supplier. Suppliers can inquiry through inquiry forms and admin panel can view them and answer. The supplier connection is handled through a mobile application with the consideration of ease of use where the other part of the system is handled through the web. Customer management part is done through the mobile application where a customer is able to request for the registration and the registration process is considered by the customer manager. A customer is able to place an order and view purchase history as well.  All in all, both the systems are integrated with each other in order to proceed the functions.
